# Happiness 

There are two generally accepted classes of happiness. The first is pleasure, or hedonistic satisfaction. This is how one feels in _this_ moment. The second is one’s overall satisfaction with life and is usually called _well-being_. They do not always measure in equal because even though we use the word happiness to gauge both, they are often very independent things.

## Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

There are roughly two philosophical literatures on “happiness,” each corresponding to a different sense of the term. One uses ‘happiness’ as a value term, roughly synonymous with well-being or flourishing. The other body of work uses the word as a purely descriptive psychological term, akin to ‘depression’ or ‘tranquility’. 

Theories of well-being—and hence of “happiness” in the well-being sense—come in three basic flavors, according to the best-known taxonomy (Parfit 1984):
 
1. hedonism, 
2. desire theories, and,
3. objective list theories. 

Hedonists identify well-being roughly with experiences of pleasure.

Desire theorists equate well-being with the satisfaction of one's desires—actually getting what you want, versus merely having certain experiences.

Both hedonism and desire theories are in some sense subjectivist, since they ground well-being in the individual's subjective states. 

Objective list theorists, by contrast, think some things benefit us independently of our attitudes or feelings: there are objective prudential goods. Aristotelians are the best-known example: they take well-being (eudaimonia) to consist in a life of virtuous activity—or more broadly, the fulfillment of our human capacities. The value ethics of Stoicism is another strong example. A passive but contented couch potato may be getting what he wants, and he may enjoy it. But he would not, on Aristotelian and other objective list theories, count as doing well, or leading a happy life.
